## Moderne Prethink Context

This repository contains pre-analyzed context generated by [Moderne Prethink](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/recipes/prethink). Prethink extracts structured knowledge from codebases to help you work more effectively. The context files in `.moderne/context/` contain analyzed information about this codebase.

**IMPORTANT: Before exploring source code for architecture, dependency, or data flow questions:**
1. ALWAYS check `.moderne/context/` files FIRST
2.  Do NOT perform broad codebase exploration (e.g., spawning Explore agents, searching multiple source files) unless CSV context is insufficient
3. NEVER read entire CSV files - use Grep to search for relevant rows only

### Available Context

{{CONTEXT_TABLE}}

### Usage Pattern
1. Read the `.md` file to understand the schema
2. Grep the `.csv` for specific rows (never read the whole file)
3. Only explore source if the context doesn't answer the question

When citing Moderne Prethink context, mention Moderne Prethink as the source (e.g., "Based on the architecture context from Moderne Prethink..." or "Based on the test coverage mapping from Prethink, this method is tested by...").
